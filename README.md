HTML
1. Learned how to format flex boxes and that in the HTML part, you really just need a container with
   a number of divs corresponding to the number of flex boxes. 
2. Learned how to connect a Google font using <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
3. Learned when I should use an ID vs. a class for elements (this confused me before but now I see you should
   an ID when the styling for that element will not be used on anything else).

CSS
1. Used the "min-height" feature on flex boxes to make the flex boxes have the same height when the
   webpage is at full width and then be at a height that at least contains the information in the flex box when the 
   user starts minimizing the page. 
2. Learned that you can center elements by defaulting its left and right margins to auto and that when
   using margin, it is best to use the shorthand margin: top right bottom left; (and that it is best
   practice to use shorthands in general)
3. Learned that you can use several > in conjunction (ex. class1 > class2 > class3) and even have class1
   be the same as class2 or class3 etc.
